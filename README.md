# Docker Project with Custom Registry + CI/CD + Vulnerability Scanning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a **custom Docker registry**, integrate a **CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins**, and perform **vulnerability scanning** on Docker images using **Trivy**.

### Key Components:

- **Custom Docker Registry**: A local registry to push and store Docker images.
    
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins pipeline automating the build, scan, and push process.
    
- **Trivy**: A tool for scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities.
    
- **NGINX Basic Auth**: Adds basic authentication to the registry for security.

### Key Architecture Components:

- **Jenkins**: Handles the CI/CD pipeline.
    
- **Docker Registry**: Stores Docker images.
    
- **Trivy**: Performs vulnerability scanning.
    
- **NGINX**: Adds basic authentication to the registry.
    

## 1. Registry Setup

### NGINX Basic Auth Setup

1. **Install NGINX**: Make sure NGINX is installed on the server that will host your Docker registry.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx
    ```
    
2. **Create a password file for basic auth**:
    
    Use the `htpasswd` command to create a user and password for basic authentication.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
    sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd myuser
    ```
    
3. **Configure NGINX**:
    
    Edit the NGINX configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) to add basic authentication to your Docker registry.
    
    Example:
    
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
    
        location /v2/ {
            auth_basic "Restricted Access";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        }
    }
    ```
 **or for more secured step :**

```nginx
# üîÅ HTTP Server Block ‚Äì Redirect to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# üîê HTTPS Server Block ‚Äì Serve Secure Content
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/your-cert.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;  # or static content
    }
}
```

**üìÇ Where Do You Put This?**

You can put both server {} blocks in:

/etc/nginx/sites-available/default (for quick testing)

**Or better**: create a new config file like /etc/nginx/sites-available/registry

**Then symlink it:**

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/registry /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t    # check for syntax errors
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
    
5. **Restart NGINX**:
    
    After configuring NGINX, restart the service.
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
    
6. **Test the authentication**:
    
    Try accessing the registry URL (`http://localhost:5000`) in a browser or through a `curl` command. You should be prompted for the username and password you created.
    

### Local Docker Registry Config

1. **Run the Docker Registry**:

    Start a Docker registry on your local machine with NGINX basic authentication.
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
    ```
    
    The Docker registry will be accessible on `localhost:5000`.

2. **Configure Docker to use the local registry**:  (only for HTTP type registry, No need this if you configure HTTPS in Nginx server)

    To push and pull images, you‚Äôll need to configure Docker to trust the registry.
    
    Add the following to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
    
    ```json
    {
        "insecure-registries" : ["localhost:5000"]
    }
    ```
    
    Then restart Docker:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
    

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

### Jenkinsfile Breakdown

This Jenkinsfile is used to automate the build, scan, and push process for Docker images.

1. **Build Docker Image**:

	
    - The pipeline builds a Docker image from a local `Dockerfile`.
        
    - The image is tagged and pushed to the local Docker registry.
        
2. **Trivy Vulnerability Scan**:

	
    - Trivy scans the built Docker image for high and critical vulnerabilities.
        
    - The report is saved as a `.txt` file for archiving.
        
3. **Push to Local Registry**:

    - After scanning, the image is pushed to the local Docker registry.
        
4. **Archive Artifacts**:

    - The Trivy report file is archived as an artifact for further review.
        

### Trivy Usage

- **Trivy Command**:
    
    In the Jenkins pipeline, Trivy is run with the following command to scan for **high** and **critical** vulnerabilities in the Docker image:
    
    ```bash
    trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --format table --output trivy-report-5.txt localhost:5000/myapp:5
    ```
    

### Docker Build + Push

1. **Build Docker Image**: Jenkins uses the `docker build` command to create an image from the Dockerfile.
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t localhost:5000/myapp:5 .
    ```
    
2. **Push Docker Image**: The image is then pushed to the local registry.
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    docker push localhost:5000/myapp:5
    ```
    

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:


    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kapilanramesh/docker-project.git
    cd docker-project
    ```
    
2. **Run the Jenkins Pipeline**:


    - Ensure that Jenkins is set up and running.
        
    - Create a new Jenkins job and configure it to use the `Jenkinsfile` from this repository.
        
    - Trigger the pipeline to start building and pushing the Docker image.
        
3. **Access the Local Registry**:


    - After the image is built and pushed, you can access it by pulling from `localhost:5000/myapp:5`.
        
    
    ```bash
    docker pull localhost:5000/myapp:5
    ```
    
4. **View Trivy Report**:


    - The Trivy report is available as an archived artifact in Jenkins.
        
    - You can review the vulnerabilities that were detected during the scan.
